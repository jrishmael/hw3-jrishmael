# HW3 - React 312 App with Supabase

In the previous Homework, you worked on creating a react app with local state maintained with useState prop. For this Homework, you will start with the 
react app which uses local state and then add code to make it work with a backend hosted on supabase.

The skeleton code contains a fully functional code with local state maintained in react. 

## Getting Started 

Open the terminal window and type in `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file and will create a folder `node_modules` where all these dependencies will be installed. `npm run dev` will run a local development server and open a web browser window for you that's pointed at your application.

## What is Supabase ? 

Supabase is hosted backend which provides plethora of ways to rapidly develop a web application. To know more about it take a look at [this](https://supabase.com/docs) link. 

In your skeleton code, a supabaseClient code is present. You can use the client code diretly by modifying the .env file. Please add the appropriate URL and anon key related to your account. **While submiting your project though please make sure that you add .env file into the .gitignore**
